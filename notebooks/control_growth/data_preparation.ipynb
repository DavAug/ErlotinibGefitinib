    "In [1], the tumour growth inhibition (TGI) PKPD model of Erlotinib and Gefitinib was derived from two separate *in vivo* experiments. In particular, patient-derived tumour explants LXF A677 (adenocarcinoma of the lung) and cell line-derived tumour xenografts VXF A431 (vulva cancer) were subcutaneously implanted in mice. Each experiment comprised a control group and six groups treated with either Erlotinib or Gefitnib at one of three dose levels each. Treatments were orally administered once a day.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverstigation of the full TGI-PKPD model is not subject of this notebook, but may be found in other notebooks of this repository (reference appear once they exist). Here, we focus on establishing a good understanding of the untreated tumour growth. In particular, this will allow us to critically assess the modelling choices in [1], and explore alternatives. It further allows us to derive posteriors for the growth parameters, that may inform the choice of priors for the full TGI-PKPD model inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now import the data sets and standardise it's format for the inference."

    "## Cleaning the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how the first data set seems to contain a lot more information than the second one. However, there is a lot of information that is not relevant for us. These data sets were manipulated with Monolix. That is why the meaning of most column keys can be looked up in the Monolix documentation. However, there are some customised keys whose meaning is not immediately clear. \n",
    "\n",
    "All we really need for our analyis is\n",
    "\n",
    "- **#ID** indicating which mouse was measured,\n",
    "- **TIME** indicating the time point of each measurement,\n",
    "- **TUMOUR VOLUME** indicating the measured tumour volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the columns **#ID** and **TIME** are easy to idenitfy in the data sets, **TUMOUR VOLUME** was intentionally chosen to be outside of the existing column keys. In both data sets there exist two keys that may potentially encode for the measured tumour volumes: **Y** and **YTV** in LXF; and **TUMOR** and **YTV** in VXF. The true measurements of the first experiment are easily identified by looking into the Monolix documentation. **Y** is here generally used as an identifier for the observations. For the second table it seems less obvious which column might contain the true data. However, in analogy with the first data set one might suspect that **YTV** is not the actual data. So until this will be clarified at a later stage, we will choose to use **TUMOR** as the true data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remarks on remaining column keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DOSE**: Seems to be a customised key encoding for the applied dose. This is the control group so we should ensure that this column has only NaN or zero entries.\n",
    "- **ADDL**, **II**: According to Monolix these keys encode for the number of doses (ADDL) to add in addition to the dose in intervals specified by II. Since this is supposed to be the control group, we should filter out any rows with non-null values for these keys.\n",
    "- **YTYPE**, **CENS**: According to Monolix these keys encode for the data type (tumour volume in this case) and whether the measurered values were subject to censoring. We should make sure that censored data should be dealt with accordingly and only one data type is present in the data set.\n",
    "- **CELL LINE**, **DOSE GROUP**, **DRUG**, **EXPERIMENT**: These customised keys are quite self-explanatory. We should make sure that the data we use is uni-valued in these columns.\n",
    "- **DRUGCAT**: The meaning of this key is less clear. It may refer to the drug category encoding for the route of administration. We should make sure that this column is also only uni-valued. If mutliple values are assumed we need to clarify what this column means.\n",
    "- **BW**: refers to the body weight of the mouse at the time of the measurement.\n",
    "- **KA**, **V**, **KE**, **w0**: These keys are customised keys, whose meaning is not immediately clear. They appear to be parameters of the PKPD model. We are interested in infering parameters, so we are not interested in any previously obtained parameters, and choose to ignore this column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remarks on units of relevant columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw data sets do not contain the units of the measured quantities. From the reference [1], we may however infer that \n",
    "- **TIME**: was measured in $\\text{day}$, and\n",
    "- **TUMOUR VOLUME**: was measured in $\\text{mm}^3$. \n",
